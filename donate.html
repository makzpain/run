      <h1>FireFTP Charity Project</h1>
      or: we're all in this thing together<br><br>
      <h3>Where did this money go?</h3>
        After 13 years and 25 million downloads later, donations are no longer being accepted. Firefox has dropped support for FireFTP and FireSSH. I recommend using <a href="https://www.waterfoxproject.org">Waterfox</a> to continue using the addons. Over the years the money went to an orphanage, LGBT rights, domestic violence support, planting trees, and bikes for the disabled.<br/>
        Thank you for your support over the years!
      <h3>Business Transparency: how much did the FireFTP project raise over the years?</h3>
      Here's how much support the project has gotten over the years.  Thank you to all who donated over the years - I very much appreciate it!<br><br>

      <h3>I have no money right now - what else can I do?</h3>
        You, yes <b>you</b>, can be just a positive influence, if not more by helping out right where you are, in your local community.<br/><br/>

        <i>Suggestions on different ways of being awesome:</i><br/>
        Volunteer.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.<br/>
        Take what you're passionate about and see how you can also make it beneficial to your community.<br/>
        If you own a business, donate proceeds to green energy or charity or something beneficial.<br/>
        Support local businesses and encourage them to do the above.<br/>
        Buy locally grown food and get a reusable bag.<br/>
        Ride your bike instead of taking your car.<br/>
        Go hang out with your kids more.<br/>
        Go hang out with your parents more.<br/>
        Take only what you need, not what you can get.<br/><br/>

        So, in conclusion, as <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/06/061906.html">Ze Frank</a> would say: just be awesome.
