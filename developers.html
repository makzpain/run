        <br/>
        I'm back on summer vacation in Croatia so I thought it appropriate to finish version 1.0 at the place where I began all this madness...Back in 2004, I had heard about this crazy, newfangled browser that was coming out soon called Firebird (today known as Firefox).  It was my summer vacation, I was bored out of my mind - I had just graduated with my brand spanking new computer science degree in hand and I felt like doing something useful with it.  Et voil&#224;!  FireFTP is the result.<br/><br/>It's been no cake walk - developing for Mozilla is tough stuff, there's like a jazillion languages to learn to do it and I realized just how little school had prepared me for real world programming (thanks a freakin' lot, alma mater!)  Anyway, I released my first version after a couple months of tinkering (0.82 - "Sir Prize" - by the way if you haven't noticed the pattern by now - I name each version after the name of a song with a person in its title from bands that I love).  It worked, kinda.  To be honest, back then, I thought I was pretty much done with thing right then and there - it's fine the way it is, right?  Good enough, right?  Hah, oh, how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Four years later (off and on) of development though, FireFTP has grown as a program, I've grown as a programmer and I think it's safe to say FireFTP is pretty decent now :)  I'll be the first one to admit it, really - FireFTP didn't honestly even start being a good program until mid-2006 - that's just how long it's taken.  There were just so many obstacles and so much I had to learn about Mozilla and programming in general (p.s. thanks Assaf! thanks MDG!) that it ended up taking two years.  But hey, you have to rely on patience and the whole "Try, try again" thing.  Plus, once I start something I just can't stop until I'm absolutely finished with it or as my dad would say "Kad radi&#353; ne&#353;to, radi da valja" which is Croatian for "When you do something, do it right."  Thanks, Pops!  Good advice.<br/><br/>It's both a great joy and great frustration programming FireFTP but I love doin' it and I love that it's useful for so many people.

        <br/><br/>My sincere thanks to everyone who's helped over the years, especially: Devin Pohly, Scott Bentley, Tyler Sticka, all the translators, Simon Tatham, Patrick Brunschwig, my supportive family (Tata i Mama, Andja, Stipo), all others who submitted bugs, gave feedback, and/or sent encouraging emails.  Special thanks to everyone who has donated!

        well, 0.91 was short-lived, wasn't it?<br/>
        this version, by all looks of it, fixes the crashes that happened on uploading files (on all platforms: windows, linux, and mac).
        the crashing had been a problem for two years now. <i>two years!</i> if it annoyed the hell out of my users, you can believe
        it freakin' drove me nuts.  anyway, i finally made a breakthrough after i got a tip from one of my co-workers
        over at <a href="http://www.mozdevgroup.com/">mozdev group</a> and now all is well under the sun :)<br/><br/>

        also in 0.92...<br/>
        tweaked to remember last account<br/>
        changed alert dialog to accept multiple alerts so you don't have a bazillion dialogs popup<br/>
        optimized how often TYPE and CWD commands are sent to the server<br/>

        <b>what's new/changes</b><br/>
        added SSL/TLS!<br/>
        added a site manager!<br/>
        added integration of ftp links from the firefox browser!<br/>
        added open with (program manager) for local files!<br/>
        added view as web page feature for remote files!<br/>
        added multiple file selection in properties window (recursive as well!) so you can find out total number of bytes for a number of files!!<br/>
        added ability to perform CHMOD change on a selection of files, folders, subfolders and subfiles and to filter that the CHMOD only happens to files or folders or both!! (this is remote only for now; local chmod on linux is kind of funky through mozilla, specifically suid, guid, and sticky bits - don't say i didn't warn you - hey, what's brown and sticky? a stick! ...ah, that joke never gets old)<br/>
        added diffing of directories!<br/>
        added thumbnails for pictures and web pages! (thumbnail and filmstrip view will be coming in the future)<br/>
        added permissions for local linux files!<br/>
        added custom commands!<br/>
        added option to change case of downloads/uploads!<br/>
        added pause button!<br/>
        added new preferences (keep alive function, log filter, overwrite disable, show bytes instead of kilobytes)<br/>
        added ability to change read-only property for local files<br/>
        added drag and drop ability from os (thanks to scott)<br/>
        added help button (help files still need to be written though :)<br/>
        added simple skin<br/>
        added new columns for file types<br/>
        better performance - should be faster ui, faster downloads!!<br/>
        better log control (filter out only errors and it only keeps like the last 200 lines around (otherwise memory gets hogged))<br/>
        better proxy interface<br/>
        and again, lots of bug fixes (it's almost perfect, folks - it's getting there)<br/>
        <br/>
        skipped version number .89 and went straight to .90 because this one kicks just that much more ass<br/>
        some software bloat by about 20KB.  yes, painful, i know.  but look above, you punk - that's like 1KB per feature!  ah, i loves my fox.<br/>
        probably no more features will be added before 1.0 although i would have liked to have solved the things listed <a href="todo.html">here</a><br/>
        changed fireFTP to FireFTP - looks more official i guess, more sophisticated. it's almost all growns up

        <h2>release notes 0.82</h2>

        version 0.82alpha <a href="http://www.starlightmints.com/">'sir prize'</a> (September 20th, 2004)<br/>
        initial release  (firefox only)<br/><br/>

        operating systems tested:    windows xp<br/>
        operating systems untested:  linux, mac, os/2, others?<br/>
        ftp servers tested:          unix style, ms-dos style<br/>
        ftp servers unsupported:     mac, os/2, others?<br/><br/>

        known issues<br/>
        &nbsp;- turning off auto-refresh, then uploading, then uploading the same file again will overwrite no matter what<br/>
        &nbsp;- moving folder splitters before moving center splitters causes center to jump (solutions, anyone?)<br/>
        &nbsp;- ssl: methinks i implemented it right - anyone care to validate this?<br/>
        &nbsp;- known issue: when refreshing the remote view either by use of the button or automatically<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the program the remote folder view is temporarily 'messed up' as it redraws itself.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, i am aware of the api calls begin/endUpdateBatch(). these seem to cause more problems<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than they're worth - either that or i'm just not implementing it right.<br/><br/>
        although i've tried to eradicate most of the bugs in this program (john goodman style), i am almost positive there are still some lurking about. so, as with any 'alpha' piece of software don't come cryin' if your computer starts singing 'it's a small world after all' over and over again or wants to join the peace corps. seriously, though, i have tested the 'delete' functions pretty thoroughly so at least they won't screw up. ('deleting', by the way, is not eco-friendly. it does not recycle - maybe i'll find a way to implement this in the future.)
